# Inventory

Examine the code in this repo. It represents a playerâ€™s inventory of items in a videogame. You may notice some ways it could be improved. Despite the lack of documentation and the undefined classes, try to understand what the code is doing and how you can make it better.

Think about how you could change each section of the code. For any code change that you recommend, describe **how** and **why** you would improve it - and feel free to include a code snippet of your revised version. Make your communication as *understandable*, *organized* and *sensitive* as you can, as though you were delivering a code review to a coworker. If any part of the intended design is ambiguous or unclear, you may make some assumptions, but please state those assumptions in the review. Recommend **as many** improvements as you can think of. **We care about both the quality and quantity of the suggestions you make.**
